# Juanes' Notebook
Juanes' notebook is a c++ time-saving library which consists of classic algorithms and data structures which are commonly used in competitive programming.
Currently there are 31 different algorithms. While inputs dont have description there are pretty straightforward for each of the algorithms and documentation is not given because the target of the library is to save time and not to teach. For using this library is recommended to at least know the logic behind the algorithms you will use, otherwise it will be incredibly hard to understand the code.

# Time Complexity
This library favors time complexity over space, that's why all algorithms have their respective optimizations so they are optimal in time not in space. 

# Documentation
Even though there is no existing documentation made by me yet, there is tons of explanations out there. 
Proper documentation will be released soon... here => [Documentation](https://github.com/Juanes2424/juanes_notebook) 
Happy coding! 😁
